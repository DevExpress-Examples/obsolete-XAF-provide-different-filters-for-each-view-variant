# OBSOLETE - How to provide different filters for each view variant.

This example is now obsolete. Instead, it is much simpler to specify [Criteria Property in the Application Model](https://docs.devexpress.com/eXpressAppFramework/112990/filtering/in-list-view/criteria-property-in-the-application-model) for each ListView variant node in the Model Editor. This way, each ListView variant will be filtered automatically.
